/**
 * @brief Why the thread ID remains the same after moving a std::thread.
 *
 * @details
 * - A `std::thread` object is only a **handle (RAII wrapper)** to an
 *   **underlying OS thread**.
 *
 * - When you write:
 *   @code
 *   std::thread t2 = std::move(t1);
 *   @endcode
 *   ownership of the same OS thread is transferred from `t1` to `t2`.
 *
 * - The actual thread of execution (running `func`) is not moved,
 *   paused, or restarted â€” it continues on the same OS thread.
 *
 * - Because `std::thread::get_id()` reports the ID of the underlying OS
 *   thread, the ID remains the same before and after the move.
 *
 * ### What changes after the move
 * - `t1` becomes a moved-from thread object:
 *   - It is no longer joinable (`t1.joinable() == false`).
 *   - `t1.get_id()` will return `std::thread::id()` (an empty ID).
 * - `t2` becomes the sole owner of the original thread.
 * - The OS thread continues unaffected.
 *
 * ### Analogy
 * Think of the OS thread as a drone:
 * - The drone (thread) keeps flying with the same ID.
 * - You pass the remote control from `t1` to `t2`.
 * - The old controller (`t1`) is now useless, but the drone is unchanged.
 *
 * @note
 * Seeing the same thread ID before and after moving is expected and
 * correct behavior in C++.
